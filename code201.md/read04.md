**Links are the defining feature of the web
because they allow you to move from
one web page to another â€” enabling the
very idea of browsing or surfing.**

# Writing Links

Links are created using the<a element. Users can click on anything
between the opening <a tag and the closing </a tag.
 You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

**Linking to Other Sites**

*Links are created using the <a
element which has an attribute
called href. The value of the
href attribute is the page that
you want people to go to when
they click on the link*

**Absolute URLs**

*URL stands for Uniform
Resource Locator. Every web
page has its own URL. This is the
web address that you would type
into a browser if you wanted to
visit that specific page.*

**Linking to Other Pages
on the Same Site**



*When you are linking to other
pages within the same site,
you do not need to specify the
domain name in the URL. You
can use a shorthand known as a
relative URL.*


# Directory Structure

**On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the
pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. Folders on a
website are sometimes referred to as directories.**

**Structure**

*The diagram on the right shows
the directory structure for a
fictional entertainment listings
website called ExampleArts.*

**Relationships**

*The relationship between
files and folders on a website
is described using the same
terminology as a family tree*

**Homepages**

*The main homepage of a site
written in HTML (and the
homepages of each section in a
child folder) is called index.html.*

**Building Blocks**

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

**Containing Elements**

If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.

# Controlling thePosition of Elements

**CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control
the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute
positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position
property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property**


**Normal flow**

Every block-level element
appears on a new line, causing
each item to appear lower down
the page than the previous one.
Even if you specify the width
of the boxes and there is space
for two elements to sit side-byside, they will not appear next
to each other. This is the default
behavior (unless you tell the
browser to do something else)

**Relative Positioning**

This moves an element from the
position it would be in normal
flow, shifting it to the top, right,
bottom, or left of where it
would have been placed. This
does not affect the position of
surrounding elements; they stay
in the position they would be in
in normal flow.

**Absolute positioning**

This positions the element
in relation to its containing
element. It is taken out of
normal flow, meaning that it
does not affect the position
of any surrounding elements
(as they simply ignore the
space it would have taken up).
Absolutely positioned elements
move as users scroll up and
down the page.

**To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use
box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom
and left or right it should be placed.**

**Fixed Positioning**

This is a form of absolute
positioning that positions
the element in relation to the
browser window, as opposed
to the containing element.
Elements with fixed positioning
do not affect the position of
surrounding elements and they
do not move when the user
scrolls up or down the page

**Floating Elements**

Floating an element allows
you to take that element out
of normal flow and position
it to the far left or right of a
containing box. The floated
element becomes a block-level
element around which other
content can flow.

# WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 

*Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).*

**IMMEDIATELY INVOKED FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS**

*This way of writing a function is used in several different situations. Often functions are used to ensure that the variable names do not conflict with each other (especially if the page uses more than one script).*

**VARIABLE SCOPE**

*The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be used within your code. If you declare it within a function, it can only be used within that function. This is known as the variable's scope.*

**HOW MEMORY & VARIABLES WORK**

Global variables use more memory. The browser has to remember them for as long as the web page using them is loaded. Local variables are only remembered during the period of time that a function is being executed.
