# What's a Table?

A table represents information in a grid format.
Examples of tables include financial reports, TV
schedules, and sports results.


# Basic Table Structure

*The <table  element is used
to create a table. The contents
of the table are written out row
by row*

*You indicate the start of each
row using the opening <tr tag.
(The tr stands for table row.)
It is followed by one or more*

*<td elements (one for each cell
in that row).
At the end of the row you use a
closing </tr  tag*

# Long Tables

There are three elements that
help distinguish between the
main content of the table and
the first and last rows (which can
contain different content).
These elements help people
who use screen readers and also
allow you to style these sections
in a different manner than the
rest of the table (as you will see
when you learn about CSS).


1- thead The headings of the table should
sit inside the <thead element

2- The body should sit inside the <tbody element. 

3- The footer belongs inside the <tfoot element




**CREATING MANY OBJECTS:**

**CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION**

Sometimes you will want several objects to represent similar things.
Object constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects.
First, create the template with the object's properties and methods.

**A FUNCTION IN GLOBAL SCOPE**

When a function is created at the top level of a script
(that is, not inside another object or function), then it
is in the global scope or global context.

**GLOBAL VARIABLES**

All global variables also become properties of the
window object. so when a function is in the global
context, you can access global variables using the
window object, as well as its other properties.

# STORING DATA

In JavaScript, data is represented using name/value pairs.
To organize your data, you can use an array or object to group a set of
related values. In arrays and objects the name is also known as a key.

**VARIABLES**
A variable has just one key (the variable name)
and one value.

**ARRAYS**
Arrays can store multiple pieces of information.
Each piece of information is separated by a comma.
The order of the values is important because items
in an array are assigned a number (called an index).

**MULTIPLE OBJECTS**

When you need to create multiple objects within the
same page, you should use an object constructor to
provide a template for the objects.

**INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS**

Objects store sets of name/value pairs. They can be
properties (variables) or methods (functions).



**Objects created with literal notation are good:**

• W hen you are storing I transmitting data
between applications

• For global or configuration objects that set up
information for the page

**Objects created with constructors are good when:**

• You have lots of objects used with similar
functionality (e.g., multiple slideshows I media
players/ game characters) within a page

• A complex object might not be used in code
