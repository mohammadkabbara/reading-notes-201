# Transform Syntax

The actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.



# 2D Transforms



Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane. Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis. These three-dimensional transforms help define not only the length and width of an element, but also the depth.

# 2D Rotate

The transform property accepts a handful of different values. The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees. Using a positive value will rotate an element clockwise, and using a negative value will rotate the element counterclockwise

# 2D Skew


The last transform value in the group, skew, is used to distort elements on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, or both. The syntax is very similar to that of the scale and translate values. Using the skewX value distorts an element on the horizontal axis while the skewY value distorts an element on the vertical axis. To distort an element on both axes the skew value is used, declaring the x axis value first, followed by a comma, and then the y axis value.%p

# 3D Transforms

Working with two-dimensional transforms we are able to alter elements on the horizontal and vertical axes, however there is another axis along which we can transform elements. Using three-dimensional transforms we can change elements on the z axis, giving us control of depth as well as length and width.

# Transitional Property

The transition-property property determines exactly what properties will be altered in conjunction with the other transitional properties. By default, all of the properties within an elementâ€™s different states will be altered upon change. However, only the properties identified within the transition-property value will be affected by any transitions.
