# Choosing Images for Your Site

*A picture can say a thousand words, and great
images help make the difference between an
average-looking site and a really engaging one*

# Adding Images 

**To add an image into the page
you need to use an <img
element. This is an empty
element (which means there is
no closing tag). It must carry the
following two attributes:**

**src**

*This tells the browser where
it can find the image file. This
will usually be a relative URL
pointing to an image on your
own site.*


**alt**
*This provides a text description
of the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it.*


**title**

*You can also use the title
attribute with the <img element
to provide additional information
about the image. Most browsers
will display the content of this
attribute in a tootip when the
user hovers over the image.*


**Where to Place Images
in Your Code**

*1: before a paragraph
The paragraph starts on a new
line after the image.*


*2: inside the start of a
paragraph
The first row of text aligns with
the bottom of the image.*


*3: in the middle of a
paragraph
The image is placed between the
words of the paragraph that it
appears in.*


# Three Rules for Creating Images

1- **Save images in
the right format**
Websites mainly use images in
jpeg, gif, or png format. If you
choose the wrong image
format then your image might
not look as sharp as it should
and can make the web page
slower to load.

2-**Save images at
the right size**
You should save the image at
the same width and height it will
appear on the website. If
the image is smaller than the
width or height that you have
specified, the image can be
distorted and stretched. If the
image is larger than the width
and height if you have specified,
the image will take long

3-**Use the correct
resolution**
Computer screens are made up
of dots known as pixels. Images
used on the web are also made
up of tiny dots. Resolution refers
to the number of dots per inch,
and most computer screens only
show web pages at 72 pixels
per inch. So saving images at
a higher resolution results in
images that are larger than
necessary and take longer to
download.

# Foreground Color

The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:

**rgb values**

These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90)

 **hex codes**


These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80

**color names**

There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:
DarkCyan

# background-color

CSS treats each HTML element
as if it appears in a box, and the
background-color property
sets the color of the background
for that box.

**font-family**

The font-family property
allows you to specify the
typeface that should be used for
any text inside the element(s) to
which a CSS rule applies.
The value of this property is the
name of the typeface you want
to use. 

**font-size**

The font-size property enables
you to specify a size for the
font. There are several ways to
specify the size of a font. The
most common are:

**pixels**

Pixels are commonly used
because they allow web
designers very precise control
over how much space their text
takes up. The number of pixels is
followed by the letters px.

**percentages**

The default size of text in
browsers is 16px. So a size of
75% would be the equivalent of
12px, and 200% would be 32px.

**font-weight**

The font-weight property
allows you to create bold text.
There are two values that this
property commonly takes:

**normal**

This causes text to appear at a
normal weight.

**bold**

This causes text to appear bold.
In this example, you can see
that the element whose class
attribute has a value of credits
has been bolded.


**font-style**

If you want to create italic text,
you can use the font-style
property. There are three values
this property can take:

**normal**

This causes text to appear in a
normal style (as opposed to italic
or oblique).

**italic**

This causes text to appear italic.
oblique
This causes text to appear
oblique

**text-transform**


The text-transform property
is used to change the case of
text giving it one of the following
values:


**uppercase**

This causes the text to appear
uppercase.

**lowercase**

This causes the text to appear
lowercase.

**capitalize**

This causes the first letter of
each word to appear capitalized

**text-decoration**

The text-decoration property
allows you to specify the
following values:

**none**

This removes any decoration
already applied to the text.

**underline**

This adds a line underneath the
text.

**overline**

This adds a line over the top of
the text.

**line-through**

This adds a line through words.
