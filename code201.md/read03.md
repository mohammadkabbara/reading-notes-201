**There are lots of occasions when we
need to use lists. HTML provides us with
three different types:**

# 1- Ordered lists 

are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.

*The ordered list is created with
the <ol element.*

*Each item in the list is placed
between an opening <li tag
and a closing </li tag. (The li
stands for list item.)*

# 2-Unordered lists 
are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).

*The unordered list is created
with the <ul element.*

*Each item in the list is placed
between an opening <li tag
and a closing </li tag. (The li
stands for list item.)*

# 3- Definition lists
 are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.

*The definition list is created with
the <dl element and usually
consists of a series of terms and
their definitions.*

Inside the <dl element you will
usually see pairs of <dt and
<d d elements.

*<d t
This is used to contain the term
being defined (the definition
term)*

*<d d This is used to contain the
definition.*

# BOX DEMINTION

**width, height**

*By default a box is sized just big
enough to hold its contents. To
set your own dimensions for a
box you can use the height and
width properties.
The most popular ways to
specify the size of a box are
to use pixels, percentages, or
ems. Traditionally, pixels have
been the most popular method
because they allow designers to
accurately control their size.*



# Overflowing CONTENT

**overflow**

*The overflow property tells the
browser what to do if the content
contained within a box is larger
than the box itself. It can have
one of two values:

1- hidden

*This property simply hides any
extra content that does not fit in
the box.*

2- scroll

*This property adds a scrollbar to
the box so that users can scroll
to see the missing content.*


# Border, Margin & Padding


**Border**

Every box has a border (even if
it is not visible or is specified to
be 0 pixels wide). The border
separates the edge of one box
from another

**Margin**

Margins sit outside the edge
of the border. You can set the
width of a margin to create a
gap between the borders of two
adjacent boxes.

**Margin**

Margins sit outside the edge
of the border. You can set the
width of a margin to create a
gap between the borders of two
adjacent boxes.

 
  # CHange Inline/Block

  **display**

  The display property allows
you to turn an inline element
into a block-level element or vice
versa, and can also be used to
hide an element from the page.
The values this property can
take are:


**inline**

*This causes a block-level
element to act like an inline
element.*

**block**

*This causes an inline element to
act like a block-level element.*

**inline-block**

*This causes a block-level
element to flow like an inline
element, while retaining other
features of a block-level element.*

**none**

*This hides an element from the
page. In this case, the element
acts as though it is not on the
page at all (although a user could
still see the content of the box if
they used the view source option
in their browser)*

# DATA TYPES 

*JavaScript distinguishes between numbers,
strings, and true or false values known as
Booleans. *

**NUMERIC DATA TYPE**

The numeric data type handles
numbers.

**STRING DATA TYPE**

The strings data type consists of
letters and other characters.

**BOOLEAN DATA TYPE**

Boolean data types can have one
of two values: true or false. 


# SWITCH STATEMENTS

*A switch statement starts with a
variable called the switch value.
Each case indicates a possible
value for this variable and the
code that should run if the
variable matches that value.* 

**SWITCH**

• You have a default option that is run if
none of the cases match.

• If a match is found, that code is run; then
the break statement stops the rest of
the switch statement running (providing
better performance than multiple i f
statements).
