# Controlling sizes of images in CSS

You can control the size of an
image using the width and
height properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box.


Specifying image sizes helps
pages to load more smoothly
because the HTML and CSS
code will often load before the
images, and telling the browser
how much space to leave for an
image allows it to render the rest
of the page without waiting for
the image to download.


You might think that your site
is likely to have images of all
different sizes, but a lot of sites
use the same sized image across
many of their pages. 

# Background Images

The background-image
property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML
element. This could be the entire
page or just part of the page. By
default, a background image will
repeat to fill the entire box

# Repeating images

The background-repeat
property can have four values:

**repeat**

The background image is
repeated both horizontally and
vertically (the default way it
is shown if the backgroundrepeat property isn't used).

**repeat-x**

The image is repeated
horizontally only (as shown in
the first example on the left).

**repeat-y**

The image is repeated vertically
only.

**no-repeat**

The image is only shown once.
The background-attachment
property specifies whether a
background image should stay in
one position or move as the user
scrolls up and down the page. 
It
can have one of two values:

**fixed**

The background image stays in
the same position on the page.

**scroll**

The background image moves
up and down as the user scrolls
up and down the page

# CSS3: Gradients

CSS3 is going to introduce the
ability to specify a gradient for
the background of a box. The
gradient is created using the
background-image property
and, at the time of writing,
different browsers required a
different syntax.

Since it is not supported by all
browsers, it is possible to specify
a background image for the box
first (which would represent the
gradient) and then provide the
CSS alternatives for browsers
that support gradients.

On this page, we are focusing
on linear gradients. You can see
that in order to create a linear
gradient, we need to specify
two colors (that the gradient is
between).

# What Are Your Visitors Looking At?

The content link on the left-hand side allows
you to learn more about what the visitors are
looking at when they come to your site

**Pages**

This tells you which pages your
visitors are looking at the most
and also which pages they are
spending the most time on.

**Landing Pages**

These are the pages that people
arrive on when first visiting your
site. This can be particularly
helpful because you may find
people are not always coming
into your site via the homepage

**Top Exit Pages**

This shows which pages people
most commonly leave from. If
a lot of people are leaving from
the same page then you might
consider changing that page or
improving it.

**Bounce Rate**

This shows the number of people
who left on the same page that
they arrived on. A high bounce
rate suggests that the content is
not what they were looking for or
that the page did not sufficiently
encourage them to look around
the rest of the site. What counts
as a bounce:

● Clicked a link to another site

● Clicked on an advertisement

● Entered a new URL

● Used the "back" button

● Closed the browser
