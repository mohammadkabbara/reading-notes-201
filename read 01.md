# How People Access the Web ?

**Browsers**

People access websites using
software called a web browser.
Popular examples include
Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari,
Chrome, and Opera.

**Web Servers**

When you ask your browser for
a web page, the request is sent
across the Internet to a special
computer known as a web
server which hosts the website

**Screen readers**

Screen readers are programs
that read out the contents of a
computer screen to a user. They
are commonly used by people
with visual impairments.

**Devices**

People are accessing websites
on an increasing range of devices
including desktop computers,
laptops, tablets, and mobile
phones. It is important to
remember that various devices
have different screen sizes and
some have faster connections to
the web than others.

# How Websites Are Created?

All websites use HTML and CSS, but content
management systems, blogging software, and
e-commerce platforms often add a few more
technologies into the mix.

# How the Web Works

When you visit a website, the web server
hosting that site could be anywhere in the
world. In order for you to find the location of
the web server, your browser will first connect
to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

 **Since the web was first created, there have
been several different versions of HTML.**

*HTML 4
Released 1997 :With the exception of a few
elements added in HTML5
(which have been highlighted),
the elements you have seen in
this book were all available in
HTML 4.* 

*XHTML 1.0
Released 2000:In 1998, a language called XML
was published. Its purpose
was to allow people to write
new markup languages. Since
HTML was the most widely used
markup language around, it was
decided that HTML 4 should be
reformulated to follow the rules
of XML and it was renamed
XHTML. This meant that
authors had to follow some new,
more strict rules about writing
markup.*

*HTML5
Released 2000 : In HTML5, web page authors do
not need to close all tags, and
new elements and attributes will
be introduced. At the time of
writing, the HTML5 specification
had not been completed, but
the major browser makers had
started to implement many of
the new features, and web page
authors were rapidly adopting
the new markup.*



 # New Html5 Layout Elements


HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not
stopped many web page authors using them already.

1- Headers & Footers

<header> <footer>



The <header> and <footer>
elements can be used for:

● The main header or footer
that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.

● A header or footer for an
individual <article> or
<section> within the page

----

2-  Navigation
<nav>

The <nav> element is used to
contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the
primary site navigation.

3- Articles
<article>

The <article> element acts as
a container for any section of a
page that could stand alone and
potentially be syndicated

3- Asides
 <aside>

 The <aside> element has two
purposes, depending on whether
it is inside an <article>
element or not

4- Sections
<section>

The <section> element groups
related content together, and
typically each section would
have its own heading.

# Who is the Site For?

Every website should be designed for the
target audience—not just for yourself or the
site owner. It is therefore very important to
understand who your target audience is
